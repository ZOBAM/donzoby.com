                    <p>
                        Donzoby is long held vision birthed by the grace of God for the furtherance of godly
                        knowledge
                        in
                        the world of computers.</p>
                    <p>We exist to minimize or eliminate where possible and when possible the stress and pain everyone
                        else
                        have
                        to undergo in other to know what we have known in dealing with the computer system over the
                        years.
                    </p>
                    <p>Holding very close to our hearts the pains (and sometimes needless pains) we went through to
                        learn
                        certain computer and ICT skills that were supposed to be easy, we are ever the more determined
                        to
                        remove
                        every huddles on the path of timely knowledge transfer in this sector.</p>
                    <p>Added to what we do online is our Computer Literacy Outreach Program tagged: <strong>Light Up
                            Your World</strong>.
                        Within
                        this scheme, we visit communities, villages, and just any organized set of individuals that want
                        to
                        be
                        trained on the use of computer for solving everyday problems. This training could be either
                        greatly
                        subsidized or completely free depending on the arrangement we have with the organizers.</p>
